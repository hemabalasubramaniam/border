                    Citrus is a genus of flowering trees and shrubs in the rue family, Rutaceae. Plants in the genus produce citrus fruits, including important
                     crops such as oranges, lemons, grapefruits, pomelos, and limes.

                    Stone fruits get their name from the pit or "stone" in their center that is encased in a fleshy outer area. Also known as drupes, stone fruits tend
                     to have thin skins that may be fuzzy or smooth.

                    A berry is a fleshy fruit without a stone (pit) produced from a single flower containing one ovary. Berries so defined include grapes, currants, 
                    and tomatoes, as well as cucumbers, 
                    eggplants (aubergines) and bananas, but exclude certain fruits that meet the culinary definition of berries, such as strawberries and raspberries.

                    Tropical fruits have always been part of the rural landscape of these regions, with the sole purpose of providing food and nutrition. 
                    Regular consumption of a variety of fruits is recommended by FAO and the World Health Organisation 
                    (WHO) for a well-balanced diet and for avoiding cardiovascular problems, diabetes and certain types of cancer.
